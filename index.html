      Are all the tools in this repository free to use?

    <div class="answercont"> 
     <div class="answer">
       Some of the tools in this repository may be free to use, while others may require a trial or paid subscription. We do not currently provide a free/paid tag on the tools in the repository, so it is important to check the details on the tool's website before using it. Some of the tools may have limitations or require payment for certain features. We recommend reviewing the terms and conditions of the tool's website before using it. It's possible that in the future we'll add this tag for easy sorting of tools, but it's not guaranteed.

      Why are the tool links in the format of aiinfinity.blogspot.com? 
    </div> 
    <div class="answercont"> 
     <div class="answer">
       The links are in the format of aiinfinity.blogspot.com because we use this as a way to track which categories and tools are the most popular among our users. By collecting this data, we will be able to better structure our website in the future to provide a more user-friendly experience for those looking for AI tools and resources. Please note that this site will redirect to the tool site in less than 5 seconds,once we have a proper website designed, we'll remove the redirect sites.
